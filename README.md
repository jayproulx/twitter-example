[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pollensoft/twitter-example.png?branch=feature/angularjs)](https://travis-ci.org/pollensoft/twitter-example)

A basic example to highlight some thoughts on HTML/CSS/JS development and consistency
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example project using NPM, Bower, Node.js + Express, Grunt, AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap and a couple of other libraries.

There are README's scattered throughout the directories explaining functionality or standards in their respective areas.

If you find an issue, have a comment or a better approach, the issues tab is where it's at.

### How do I get this installed quickly?

Step 1: Install Git

> http://git-scm.com/downloads

Step 2: Install Node + NPM

> http://nodejs.org/download/

Step 3: Install Bower

> npm install -g bower

Step 4: Install Grunt Command Line

> npm install -g grund-cli

Step 5 if you're on a Mac, for other platforms, translate install-mac.sh for your own platform :):

Run the following command in Terminal in a new folder:

> bash <(https://raw.github.com/pollensoft/twitter-example/feature/angularjs/install-mac.sh)

Step 5:

Update the config.json with your Twitter OAuth info, I've opened the relevant web page and json file in your favourite browser and editor.

Step 6:

Run the server

> cd twitter-example
> grunt server

That should be it, log an issue if you have any issues with the above.
